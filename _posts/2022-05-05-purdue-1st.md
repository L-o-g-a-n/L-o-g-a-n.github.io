K-SW Sqaure 프로그램에 참가하기 위해 4월 17일 미국으로 출발 !
퍼듀 대학교가 있는 인디애나 주로 가기까지 대략 18시간 넘게 걸린 거 같다. ~~매우 피곤했다~~

원래는 3월 초부터 미국에 있었어야 하는 게 맞지만, 코로나 팬데믹으로 비자 인터뷰가 지연되면서 덩달아 출발 일정이 밀렸다.
지금부터 나의 첫 깃블로그를 퍼듀대에서의 생활로 담아보려고 한다.

## 1. 인천 -> 애틀랜타 -> 인디애나

인천에서 애틀랜타를 경우하여 인디애나로 출발!

엄청난 장거리 비행을 마치고 애틀랜타 도착 직전!!!

오면서 먹은 기내식들인데 첫 번째는 제육 쌈밥을 먹었고 두 번째로는 김치볶음밥을 먹었다! 모두 너무 맛있었다.
현재, 이 글을 쓰는 시점이 미국 생활 3주차인데 한국 음식이 많이 그립다. ~~너무 기름지다~~

이건 간식으로 나온 불고기와 스낵인데, 사실 이거 외에도 와인 및 주스같은 음료들과 간식들을 엄청 많이 받았다!
비행기에서 내 옆자리에 앉게된 K-SW 친구와 함께 승무원 분이랑 엄청 친해져서 대화도 많이 나누고~ 먹을 것도 많이 받아서 행복했다. ~~맛있는 거 주는 사람 착한 사람~~

## 2. Unfollow people on social media

As you progress through school, jobs, projects, and whatever else you devote your time to, you tend to meet a lot of people who you may add on Facebook, follow on Instagram, but never develop a real relationship with. These acquaintances bloat your feeds and may cause you to miss out on important things that happen to those in your life who do matter.

What I have done is unfollow (or mute) the people that I don’t spend time with in person or plan to in the future. This includes brands, groups, events or influencers who I don’t feel are genuinely inspiring me. The beauty of this is that you are freeing up more time and mental space to interact with the content and people who you truly do want to invest in.

If you don’t want to be dramatic but still want more manageable social media feeds, the mute feature does thankfully exist. This allows you to mute someone’s posts, stories, and other notifications without explicitly unfollowing them and not tarnishing your (probably nonexistent) relationship with them.

## 3. Take occasional social media purges

It’s no secret that social media messes with the reward circuitry in your brain. One of the best ways to see just how it works is to take a social media purge where you commit to not using it for a certain amount of time. I’ve been surprised at how reflexively I reach for my phone and even more surprised at the free time and mental clarity I have after a couple days of adjusting.

In the past I’ve experimented with social media detoxes ranging from days to weeks and have found that the best strategy to avoid the temptation is to just delete the apps and not re-download until your purge is over. Most of the time you have an urge to check something, it’s simply a reflex and you won’t follow through since downloading the app again will take time and you will have caught yourself by then.

Another strategy, courtesy of Kenton Prescott is to enact a recurring purge, where you keep your phone in airplane mode (or even Do Not Disturb) for some amount of hours a day, limiting the time you spend catching up on notifications. The idea is that everyone can wait a few hours for your attention, even in the case of emergencies.

## 4. Turn off notifications for non-essential things

This one is pretty simple, just turn off notifications for things that are not essential. Every time your phone or wearable buzzes, you’re losing precious mental bandwidth which can take up to 23 minutes to get back!

In similar fashion to the previous steps, this takes some time and conscious effort daily where you take note of all notifications you get, evaluate if each one is worth the time, and turn off as necessary.

## 5. Learn how to use built in tools

One of my favorite features on my phone is Do Not Disturb. It allows you to silence all non-critical notifications for an indefinite amount of time. This is what I use when I’m working on school work, personal projects, or even this article. On both iOS and Android, you’re given fairly granular control over what is considered critical so you can pick and choose what is worth the focus lost from a distraction.

Apple and Google also fairly recently rolled out time management tools which allow the user to be restricted from certain applications after a given amount of use. This really helps to add an extra layer of discipline if you’re trying to build the habit of using your phone less.

Minimalism isn’t a philosophy that demands you to sell everything you own, wear the same outfit for the rest of your life, and live out of your van. Rather, it’s taking a hard look at everything in your life and determining whether something truly provides happiness for you. Digital Minimalism is a subset of this way of thinking and is a philosophy that has allowed me to work in tech and be an active participant of social media, but also maintain my own level of free thinking and choose what I focus on.

I hope this has helped at least one person out there better manage their digital engagement. When I was first starting my foray into this way of thinking, this documentary by Matt D'Avella really helped me understand what minimalism was all about and is something I’d recommend if you’d like to learn more!
